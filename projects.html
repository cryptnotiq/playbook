Have a horizontal slider menu that looks kind of 3D. i.e main object in middle is layered infront of others
and 2nd 2 objects to left and right are one layer back and still pretty visible
then 3rd row objects are slighly less visible and look further back.

Make it like a horizontal cogwheel function so it changes very cool. Then when something
is centered and highlighted, it either automatically displays info about it below
or in some cool way, or user clicks something to see more about it.
