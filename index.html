    <p>
      Hey im E. Online I go by Cryptnotiq. Since i was 19 i have devoted my life to open and trustless financial systems, applications, concepts and everything in between. Because i believe everyone should have equal opportunity in the economy and financial ecosystem. I think it is also important to clarify however that i do not think everyone should have an equal socioeconokic position, i just want everyone to have equal access and opportunity. Thise who work harder should be rewarded more but no one ahould have an unfair advantage (as we see with todays highly centralised financial system). I invest in them, advise them, contribute to them, and build them myself. When i was younger I coded a little bit but never truly got into it until I was 26 bc i realised for me to trult achieve the impact i want to have on the financial world, investing and indirectly contributing was not going to be enough. I need to be hands on actually being able to build myself. I became involved with Bitcoin in 2013 when i started mining it, in 2014 i created the worlds first bitcoin accounting software (it failed bc no one was paying taxes back then), in 2015 i began playimg around with proof of stake. in 2016 i began getting involved with ethereum and investing in all sorts of ethereum based projects. In 2017 i started my own ethereum company. In 2018 i started workimg on DAOs launched it for my company in 2019 and also began being involved with cosmos i also burnt out this year and it was tough. In 2020 i got back on my feet i began working on Fraktal and bexoming even more involved in the cosmos ecosystem. To see more projects ive worked on click projects. I also started coding seriously at a late age so i know first hand how dofficult it can be so I compiled a list of resources that helped me learn or that i still use to help out anyone else:) bc sharing and being open is the best oath to be on:) if you want to talk, im on telegram:)
